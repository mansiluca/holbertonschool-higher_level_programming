# Python Data Structures

This project is part of the Holberton School Higher Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on Python data structures, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the different types of data structures in Python
- Learn how to manipulate data structures
- Gain proficiency in using built-in Python methods for data structures

## Project Structure

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: Function that prints all integers of a list.
- `1-element_at.py`: Function that retrieves an element from a list.
- `2-replace_in_list.py`: Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position.
- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`: Function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
- `4-new_in_list.py`: Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
- `5-no_c.py`: Function that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.
- `6-print_matrix_integer.py`: Function that prints a matrix of integers.
- `7-add_tuple.py`: Function that adds two tuples.
- `8-multiple_returns.py`: Function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
- `9-max_integer.py`: Function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
- `10-divisible_by_2.py`: Function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
- `11-delete_at.py`: Function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
- `12-switch.py`: Switches the values of two variables.
