# Python - Everything is object

## Overview
This project explores Python's object model, focusing on how Python treats different types of objects. It delves into concepts like object identity, aliasing, immutability, and reference counting.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python is an amazing language
- What is an object in Python
- The difference between class and object/instance
- The difference between immutable and mutable objects
- What is a reference, assignment, and alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables point to the same object
- How to display variable identifier (memory address)
- How Python passes variables to functions

## Tasks
The project consists of multiple answer files with short answers to questions about Python's object model. Each file contains a single line with the answer to a specific question.

## Resources
- [Objects and Values](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch09.html#objects-and-values)
- [Aliasing](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch09.html#aliasing)
- [Immutable vs Mutable Types](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8056130/immutable-vs-mutable-types)
- [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) - Visualize Python code execution

## Usage
This project is primarily educational. To test your understanding, review the questions and provide answers in the respective files.

```bash
# Example: test if your answer is correct
$ ./0-answer.txt
```

## Important Concepts
- **Identity vs Equality**: `is` vs `==`
- **Mutable objects**: Lists, dictionaries, sets
- **Immutable objects**: Integers, floats, strings, tuples
- **Reference counting**: How Python manages memory
